# Why structure by file nature?

This boilerplate is made for small apps with a few routes and not many
components/actions/reducers. For simplicity I omitted the 'containers' folder (
it is arguably better to organize your files by placing the container with its
stateless component).

This is ever changing as one might imagine. If you find it useful feel free to
clone it.
